# Making the car go

## Circuit diagram

Let's go over the connections diagram:

![[If you can't view this image I hope you can read schematics](./section1_schematic.pdf)](./pictures/section1_schematic.jpg)

1. Battries pack

1. Motors

1. H-bridge, controls the motors. [For more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H_bridge)

1. Main switch

1. Arduino / Genuino 101. The part the we program

If you can read this diagram, and you understand how to connect everything, [you can move on to the code!](#code)

## Connect everything

If you are very scared, and can't understand how everything has to be connected, fear not! Follow this instructions:

1. First, we connect everything to a common ground (Using black wires). We connect the negative side of the batteries (black wire) to the middle terminal of the H-bridge. Also, we connect the middle terminal to the negative wire of the power jack  (black wire). We'll connect the power jack to the arduino

1. Now, we connect the motors to the side terminals of the H-bridge.

1. After we connected the motors, we connect the arduino to the input pins in like this: Pin 8 to In1, Pin 9 to In2 etc. Important: Make sure that all jumpers (small black plastic connectors are in the H-bridge)

1. Last but not least, connect the red wire of the batteries to one side of the switch, and the other side to the __left__ terminal of the H-bridge (+12V). Also, connect the left side to the other wire on the arduino

Done with wires, let's go over the code:

## Code

[Link to the base code](./code%20no1/code%20no1.ino)
Upload the code to the arduino, and then send 1 using the application on your phone (That was installed in Secion0)

Let's say that the front is the side that Arduino sits on. If the car goes forward, you are good to go and implement the other directions. If it turns to either side, switch the wires of the motors on the H-bridge. If it goes backwards, switch both wires of both motors.

## Troubleshooting

### My car randomly stops!

Most likely, that when you switch directions the motors consume a lot of current, which makes the voltage drop, and forces the arduino into reset. When switching directions, try stopping all of the motors, wait for about 100ms and then change the direction.
If you don't like the delay, add a 1000Î¼F and a 10nF in paraller to the battery output. __Make sure that the polarity of the capacitor is correct__. Then add 2 100nF capacitors(ceramic) in paraller to the motor.
